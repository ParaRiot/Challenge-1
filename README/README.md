Jay Hakimi, 6/5/2022

Description:
Client requested a codebase for their website to optimize it for search engines. Semantic HTML elements were added to both HTML and CSS
to make both more concise and readable. Alt attributes were added to images for screen readers and general clean-up of code shortened
the length of the HTML and CSS code. All changes done while keeping the appearance of the client's website unchanged.
